# 6.6.2 Exhaustive Backtracking Recursive Descent

In the previous section we saw that we have to be careful not to accept a choice too early; it can only be accepted when it leads to a successful parse. Now this demand is difficult to express in a recursive-descent parser; how do we obtain a procedure that tells us whether a choice leads to a successful parse? In principle there are in- finitely many of these, one for each sentential form (the prediction) that must derive the rest of the input, but we just cannot write them all. However, at any point during the parsing process we are dealing with only one such sentential form: the current prediction, so we could try to build a parsing procedure for this sentential form dy- namically, during parsing. Some programming languages offer a useful facility for this purpose: procedure parameters. With procedure parameters, a procedure can ac- cept another procedure (or even the same one) as a parameter and call it, or pass it on to another procedure.

Let us see how we can use procedure parameters to write a parsing procedure for a symbol X. This procedure for X is passed a procedure tail that parses the rest of the sentence, the part that follows the X . Such procedures are called continuations, since they embody the continuation of the work to be done. So a call X(tail) will parse the entire input by first parsing X and then calling tail to parse the rest. This is the approach taken for all non-terminals, and, for the time being, for terminals as well.

The parsing procedure for a terminal symbol a is easy: it tries to match the current input symbol with a. If it succeeds, it advances the input position, and calls the tail parameter; then, when tail returns, it restores the input position and returns. If it fails it just returns. So the abstract code for a is where the input is in an array text and the input position in the variable tp.

The parsing procedure for a non-terminal A is more complicated. The simplest case is A → ε, which is implemented as a call to tail. The next simple case is A → X, where X is either a terminal or a non-terminal symbol. To deal with this case, we must remember that we assume that we have a parsing procedure for X, so the implementation of this case consists of a call to X, with the tail parameter.

The next case is A → XY , with X and Y symbols. The procedure for X expects a procedure for “what comes after the X” as parameter. Here this parameter procedure is built using the Y and the tail procedures: we create a new procedure out of these two. This, by itself, is a simple procedure: it calls Y , with tail as a parameter. If we call this procedure Ytail, we can implement A by calling X with Ytail as parameter. So the abstract code for the rule A → XY is

And finally, if the right-hand side contains more than two symbols, this technique has to be repeated: for a rule A → X1X2 ···Xn we create a procedure for X2 ···Xn and tail using a procedure for X3 · · · Xn and tail, and so on. So the abstract code for a rule A→X1X2···Xn is

![图6.6.2_3](../../img/6.6.2_3.png)

Here X2···Xntail, X3···Xntail, etc., are just names of new procedures. We see the prediction stack at the start of procedure Xn is represented by and encoded in the sequence of calls of X1, X2 ···Xn, andtail.

Finally, if we have a non-terminal with n alternatives, that is, we have A → α1|···|αn, the parsing procedure for A has n consecutive code segments, one for each alternative, according to the above abstract code. They all call tail in their in- nermost procedures.

Applying this technique to all grammar rules results in a parser, except that we do not have a starting point yet. This is easily obtained: we just call the procedure for the start symbol, with the procedure for recognizing the end marker as a parameter.

This end-marker procedure is different from the others, because this is the proce- dure where we finally find out whether a parsing attempt succeeds. It tests whether we have reached the end of the input and if so, reports that we have found a parsing; it has no parameters, and so does not call any tail. Its abstract code is

![图6.6.2_4](../../img/6.6.2_4.png)

The abstract code for the rule A → X1X2 ···Xn declares the auxiliary procedures X2 ···Xntail to Xntail as local procedures to that for A. This is necessary because tail must be accessible from Xntail and the only scope from which tail is accessible is inside the procedure for A. So to use this coding technique in practice we need a programming language that allows local procedures and allows them to be passed as parameters; unfortunately this rules out almost all present-day programming lan- guages. The only reasonable possibilities are GNU C and the functional languages. GNU C is a widely available extension of C, and is used in the code below; parser writing in functional languages is treated briefly in Section 17.4.2. The technique can also be used in languages without local procedures, but then some trickery is required; see Problem 6.4.

Listings 6.13 and 6.14 present a fully backtracking recursive-descent parser for the grammar of Figure 6.6, written in GNU C. The program has a mechanism to remember the rules used (the procedures pushrule() and poprule() in Listing 6.14), so the rules can be printed for each successful parse. We see that, for example, the rule B->bBc corresponds to the code

We have also used GNU C’s facility to mix declarations and statements.

Figure 6.12 presents a sample session with this program. Note that no error message is given for the incorrect input abca; the parser just finds zero parsings.

We see that we can perform recursive descent by interpreting the grammar, as in Section 6.6.1, or by generating code and compiling it, as in Section 6.6.2. It is sometimes useful to make the distinction; the first can then be called interpreted recursive descent and the second compiled recursive descent.
